Installation
============

This section provides instructions on how to install JWSToolKit.

The first step before installing JWSToolKit on your machine is to make sure you have created a python environment 
separate from your Python system. By installing JWSToolKit, dependencies will be installed that can break and modify your existing system dependencies. 

To install the package with pip, use the following command:  

.. code-block:: console

    pip install JWSToolKit

If you want to install a specific version of the package, use the command line: 

.. code-block:: console 

    pip install JWSToolKit==1.0.4

Finally, if the package is already installed on your machine but you wish to update it, use one of the commands: 

.. code-block:: console
    
    pip install --upgrade JWSToolKit
    pip install --upgrade JWSToolKit==1.0.4
