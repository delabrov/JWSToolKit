===================

The tools were developed by Valentin Delabrosse, during his thesis on the analysis of protostellar outflows from DG Tau B using JWST observations of Cycle 1 ID: 1644 (PI: Catherine Dougados). 
These codes were used to analyze the data and represent the results presented in Delabrosse et al. 2024 and Delabrosse et al. 2025 in prep.
